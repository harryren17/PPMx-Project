Existing maintenance strategies have significant inefficiencies. Programs
often replace parts too early, which increases costs, or replace parts too
late, which decreases readiness while increasing the risk of machine
damage and operator injuries. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has
publicly expressed interest in a Predictive and Prognostic Maintenance
(PPMx) system that aims to reduce these inefficiencies. PPMx can reduce
excess maintenance as well as minimizing part costs and unexpected
failures through training machine learning models to predict part failure
based on live sensor data.


The Maintenanceand Data Decision Analytics Directive (MAD DAD) is a fulllifecycle approach for a PPMx solution built off live sensor readings. The
teamperformed data validation and exploratory data analysis to informthe
training of machine learningmodels thatpredict component failures. The
full solution encompasses an analytics dashboard to display data validation,
KPIs and insights from the models. Finally, a cost benefit analysis was
performed to determine which model optimized cost and availability.
The results demonstrate that the PPMx solution offers a reproducible
playbook for organizations to follow that decrease excess maintenance
events and unplanned failures. This proof-of-concept product justifies
further investment into a PPMx solution forimplementation on priority
systems and fleets within the DoD environment.
